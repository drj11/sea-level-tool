Each station series is a zip file containg one .dat file for each year:

    h999a88.dat

"999a" is the station identifier (jaslid column); "88" is the last two
digits of the year. The initial letter is "h" for years 1900 to 1999, "i"
for years 2000 onwards (to 2099?).

Within each file, each day consists of two rows, presumably the first
twelve hourly readings and the second twelve hourly readings.

Missing data are recorded as 9999 (see for example i834a01.dat date
20010727).
